# EXCER-AUTH [NOT DONE]

EXCER-AUTH is a Python library that provides user authorization functionalities. It is a self-hosted API that offers a range of features, including checking for a unique hardware identifier (HWID) and setting a limit on the number of devices that can use a single authorization key.

This library also allows checking if the key has expired, enabling effective authorization management and avoiding potential security threats.

One of the additional features of EXCER-AUTH is encrypting requests using the AES algorithm, which enhances the API security level and protects transmitted data from unauthorized access.

Thanks to its ease of use and rich functionality, EXCER-AUTH can be used in various projects that require effective user authorization and secure information exchange.
